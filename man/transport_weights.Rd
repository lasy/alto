\usage{
transport_weights(gammas, betas, reg = 0.1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gammas}{(required) A list of length two, containing the mixed
membership matrices (a \code{matrix} of dimension n-samples by k-topics) to
compare. The number of columns may be different, but the number of samples
must be equal.}

\item{betas}{(required). A lsit of length two, containing the topic matrices
(a \code{matrix} of dimension k-topics by d-dimensions).) The number of rows
may be different, but the number of columns must remain fixed.}

\item{reg}{(optional) How much regularization to use in the Sinkhorn optimal
transport algorithm? Defaults to 0.1.}

\item{...}{(optional) Other keyword arguments. Not used here, but included
for consistency with other weight functions.}
}
\value{
products A \code{data.frame} giving the product similarity of each
pair of topics across the two input matrices.
}
\description{
An alignment based on transport weights sets the weight between topics k and
k' according to an optimal transport problem with (1) costs set by the
distance (specifically, Jensen-Shannon Divergence) between \eqn{\beta_{k}}
and \eqn{\beta_{k^\prime}} and (2) masses defined by the total topic mixed
memberships \eqn{\sum_{i}\gamma_{ik}} and \eqn{\sum_{i}\gamma_{ik^\prime}}.
If topics have similar mixed membership weight and similar topic \eqn{\beta},
then they will be given high transport alignment weight.
